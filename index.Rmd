# Overview
The purpose of this tutorial is perform a one sample t-test using the *Mtcars* data in R.  By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to:

<style>
div.pink { background-color:#facfd7; border-radius: 5px; padding: 15px;}
</style>
<div class = "pink">

* Display the data graphically.
* Check assumptions for a one-sample t-test.
* Perform and interpret a one-sample t-test.
</div>

#### The Dataset: *Motor Trend Car Road Tests*
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

## Question
Is the average miles per gallon for the vehicles better than 22 mpg?

### Hypotheses

#### Null

$H_0: \mu = 22$  
The true population mean miles per gallon for the vehicles is 22 mpg.


#### Alternative

$H_A: \mu > 22$  
The true population mean miles per gallon for the vehicles is greater than 22 mpg.

### The Data
*Mtcars* is a dataset that comes with R.  Simply type *mtcars* and you can view the data.
```{r, eval=FALSE, class.source="fold-show"}
mtcars
```
**************************

## Calculations

### Step 1: Examine the data.
##### We will begin by examining the first five rows of the dataset.  Let's see how many data lines and variables are in the data.

```{r Dataset, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5,])
```

```{r Dim, echo=FALSE}
paste('There are', nrow(mtcars), 'rows of data and ', ncol(mtcars), 'variables.')
```


### Step 2: Check  condtions/assumptions. {.tabset}
#### Conditions
The following conditions should be checked to use a one-sample t-test: 

1. Randomization
  * Was the data randomly selected?
2. Continuity
  * Is the response variable continuous?
3. Independence
  * Are the observations are independent of one another?
4. Normality
  * Is the response variable normally distributed?
  * Does the data contain any extreme outliers?

#### Boxplot
```{r box1}
boxplot(mtcars$mpg, main="Boxplot of Miles per Gallon for the Vehicles",
        col="#ff91a4", ylab="MPG")
```

#### Summary
```{r sum1, echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
paste("Sample size, n = ", nrow(mtcars))
```

#### Histogram
```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg, main="Histogram of Miles per Gallon for the Vehicles", xlab = "MPG", col="#8DB600")
```


#### Q-Q Plot
```{r, QQ}
qqnorm(mtcars$mpg, col="#8DB600", pch=16)
qqline(mtcars$mpg, col="#ff91a4", lwd=3)
```

#### Check Conditions

- [ ] Randomly selected       *It is unclear how the data were selected.  We will assume the data is representative of the population.*
- [x] Continuous
- [x] Independent
- [x] Normally distributed       *The sample size is greater than 30 and the data is slightly skewed.  T-test are robust to normality, therefore we will proceed with a one-sample t-test.*



******************************

### Step 3: Perform t-test

```{r t-test, class.source="fold-show"}
carsttest<-t.test(mtcars$mpg, alternative = "greater", mu=22); carsttest
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
p<-as.numeric(carsttest[3])
```




## Interpretation

Using a one-sample t-test, there is insufficient evidence ( t = `r carsttest[1]`, df = `r carsttest[2]`, `r ifelse(carsttest[3]>.001, paste("p = ", round(p, 4)), "p < 0.001")`, $\alpha$ = 0.05) to reject the null hypothesis, therefore we cannot conclude that the true population mean miles per gallon is greater than 22 mpg.

## Extras {.tabset}

### Appearance
The overall look of the html output can be modified with pre-packaged themes.  The theme I chose was "cerulean."  The most noticeable difference is the font color.  The color for the headers changed from black to cerulean.

I 'highlighted' the code which makes it easier to determine what is a command versus a variable.

I highlight certain chunks of text to bring attention to it or emphasize it as important.  I did that on my objectives for this assignment.

I also added a checklist as well.

### Code Folding
I included this feature because some of my code was long, and it seems like a nice way to keep things aesthetically appealing.

### Tabs
Tabs can be added to the R Markdown html.  This feature helps to shorten the document, condense topics, and group examples.
