```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
## Example 1

This shows you how to use R **AND**  output the results.

```{r car}
summary(cars)
```

## Example 2

This shows you how to output results from R code without actually displaying the code.

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

## Example 3
This shows you how to display R code without actually running it.

```{r Plot, eval=FALSE}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

## Example 4
This shows the resutls of inline code. I can calculate the mean of the *dist* variable from the *cars* dataset as 42.98.
